\section{Conclusions}
Having integrated the functional for the grand partition function of a system of many interacting particles applying the ``layer-by-layer'' approach, we obtained a sequence of effective block Hamiltonians each characterized by its own coefficients. Since the approach is in essence an analytical one, and the coefficients are known explicitly, the recurrence relations were written down. The analysis of the recurrence relations showed the existence of a fixed-point solution. The coordinates of the fixed point were found, as well as a solution linearized near the fixed point was presented. From the condition that at large iteration number $n$ the linearized solution must be equal to the fixed-point solution, we found explicit equation for the critical temperature $T^*_c$ as a function of particle density $\rho^*$. Taking the value for the critical density from another work~\cite{YukhJSP1995}, we found the critical temperature that depends only on the parameters of the attractive part of the interaction potential. Based on this equation, the critical temperature was calculated for several hard-core van der Waals fluids and compared with known results for the considered models. The results confirm that the critical temperature of simple fluid models decreases as the range of attractive interaction decreases.
