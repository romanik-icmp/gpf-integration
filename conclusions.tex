\section{Conclusions}
By integrating the functional for the grand partition function of a system of many interacting particles using the ``layer-by-layer'' approach, we obtained a sequence of effective block Hamiltonians, each characterized by its own coefficients. Since the approach is essentially analytical and the coefficients are explicitly known, we derived the recurrence relations. Analysis of these recurrence relations revealed the existence of a fixed-point solution. We determined the coordinates of the fixed point and presented a solution linearized near the fixed point. By requiring that the linearized solution equals the fixed-point solution at large iteration numbers $n$, we derived an explicit equation for the critical temperature $T^*_c$ as a function of particle density $\rho^*$.
Using the critical density value from another work~\cite{YukhJSP1995}, we found the critical temperature that depends only on the parameters of the attractive part of the interaction potential. Based on this equation, we calculated the critical temperature for several hard-core van der Waals fluids and compared these values with known results for the considered models. The results confirm that the critical temperature of simple fluid models decreases as the range of attractive interaction decreases.
