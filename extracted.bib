  abstract =      {An approach for the description of a spatially
                   homogeneous system of interacting particles in the
                   vicinity of the critical point is proposed. An
                   explicit expression for the functional integral form
                   of the partition function in the grand canonical
                   ensemble is obtained. The functional integral is
                   defined on a set of the collective variables (CV).
                   The variable ϱk corresponds to the density vibration
                   mode with the wave vector k. It is shown that in the
                   vicinity of the critical point, for all k larger than
                   some B, the CV are distributed with the Gaussian
                   measure density. In the long wave region, k < B, the
                   surfaces of the cumulants consisting of the
                   correlation functions of some reference system (the
                   reference system is a model system of particles with
                   repulsive pair interactions) possess wide plateaus in
                   the vicinity of the point k = 0. It is shown that due
                   to these two facts the homogeneous system can be put
                   in correspondance with a certain lattice system with
                   spacing c = πB. The problem of the calculation of
                   the partition function can be reduced to the
                   calculation of the functional for a three-dimensional
                   Ising model with an external field.},

                   forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a
                   Lennard‐Jones liquid are discussed. It is found
                   that the effects of these forces are most easily
                   separated by considering the structure factor (or
                   equivalently, the Fourier transform of the
                   pair‐correlation function) rather than the
                   pair‐correlation function itself. At intermediate
                   and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate
                   the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure
                   factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in
                   the small wave vector part of the structure factor;
                   but this effect decreases as the density increases
                   and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher
                   than 0.65. These conclusions are established by
                   considering the structure factor of a hypothetical
                   reference system in which the intermolecular forces
                   are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive
                   forces in a Lennard‐Jones fluid. This reference
                   system structure factor is calculated with the aid of
                   a simple but accurate approximation described herein.
                   The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription
                   for calculating the radial distribution function of
                   dense liquids which is more accurate than that
                   obtained by any previously reported theory. The
                   thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are
                   presented in the form of calculations of the free
                   energy, the internal energy (from the energy
                   equation), and the pressure (from the virial
                   equation). The implications of our conclusions to
                   perturbation theories for liquids and to the
                   interpretation of x‐ray scattering experiments are

  abstract =      {{The present work is devoted to the study of the
                   liquid-vapor coexistence curve of hard-core Yukawa
                   fluids for range parameter λ, going from 0.5 to 7 by
                   means of an integral equation approach. Both binodal
                   and spinodal lines are computed and compared to
                   available simulation data, and the integral equation
                   used appears to be accurate. We also compare two
                   methods for determining the coordinates of the
                   critical point. The first one, using the rectilinear
                   diameter law, appears to be less accurate than the
                   second one based on the heat capacity at constant
                   volume. It is found that the critical temperature
                   decreases as the range of the interactions increases
                   and that the liquid-vapor coexistence disappears for
                   λ greater than 6.}},

                   description of the critical behavior of Morse liquids
                   based on the cell fluid model is applied to the case
                   where the parameters of the Morse interaction
                   potential correspond to alkali metals (sodium and
                   potassium). The critical temperatures, densities, and
                   pressures obtained for sodium and potassium agree
                   with the experimental results. The thermodynamic
                   coefficients (isothermal compressibility, density
                   fluctuations, and thermal expansion) of sodium are
                   investigated in the supercritical temperature region.
                   Numerical calculations of thermodynamic coefficients
                   are performed close to the critical point, where
                   carrying out theoretical and experimental research is
                   challenging. The change in compressibility with
                   increasing density at various temperature values is
                   traced. The behavior of density fluctuations
                   approaching the critical point is shown for different
                   temperatures. The variation in the magnitude of the
                   thermal expansion with increasing temperature for
                   different pressure values is illustrated.},
