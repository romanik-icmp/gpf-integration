\subsection{About potential}
We don't specify the interaction potential at the moment.

We postpone the specifying the interaction potential to a later stage of the paper. 
For now, we just restrict it to a form that it can be (quite freerely) separated into short-range repulsive and long-range attractive conterparts.
The properties of the short-range one are assumed to be known. One of the required properties for the long-range one is that it possesses a Fourier transform, and the long-wave limit ($\bf k = 0$) of it takes on a negative value.

Attractive part (tail) of the interaction. 
Specifically, the three choices for phi are the square-well potential, and the Yukawa potential.
