\section{Introduction}

General review of the collective variables method (CV) and overview of results obtained within the framework can be found in~\cite{Yukh2015En}.


The structure of this paper is as follows. We start with presenting the explicit functional of the grand partition function, with all coefficients explicitly defined. Then we proceed with the ``layer-by-layer'' integration of that functional to obtain a sequence of effective block Hamiltonians each characterized by its coefficients. After the result of integration over $n$ layers is written down in a generic form, we pass to the analysis of the recurrence relations between the effective Hamiltonian coefficients. As a result, we find the fixed point solution, write the recurrence relations in the linear approximation around the fixed point, and find the condition resulting into the equation for the critical temperature. In Section~\ref{sec:results} we calculate the critical temperature using the found expression for different hard-core van der Waals fluids and compare the obtained values with known results for the considered models.
